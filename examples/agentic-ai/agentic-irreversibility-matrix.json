  "description": "Reference data mapping consequence types to their irreversibility windows and recovery feasibility. The irreversibility window is the time between a consequence event and the point at which it becomes permanent. This is the most critical parameter for consequence-side control design: if the agent's consequence velocity exceeds the irreversibility window, prevention-heavy architectures are the only viable strategy.",
